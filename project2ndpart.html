         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampire_Diaries"> The vampire diaries</a> show revolves around a small town in Vergina, called Mystic Falls, and about the place being charged with supernatural power. The show follows the life of  Elena Gilbert, a teenage girl who lost both her parents in an accident that she was apparently in, and somehow got saved. That part of the story is just one of the many more important events that are going to happen in the show. During all these events, she will start falling in love with a 162 years old vampire named Stefan Salvatore, but then Stefan&#8217;s older brother returns, and Elena starts falling in love with him too.<p>
